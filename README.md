# Brain Busters Trivia Game

Brain Busters is a dynamic, web-based trivia game designed to challenge the knowledge of users across a variety of topics. This interactive trivia game offers a variety of categories including, but not limited to, LEGO, Photography, Space, Movies, and Sports. The game provides a fun and interactive way for users to learn new facts and test their knowledge.

Brain Busters is built using PHP for server-side processing, JavaScript for client-side interactivity, and a MySQL database for storing the trivia questions, answers, and categories. The game provides an intuitive user interface that allows players to select a category and then attempts to answer the trivia questions. Players can navigate through the trivia questions using the "Next" button and the score is updated in real-time as players answer each question.

Each trivia question is a multiple-choice question with up to four possible answers. The game's interface immediately indicates whether the user's answer was correct or incorrect and, in case of an incorrect answer, reveals the correct one. The game ends when all questions from the selected category have been answered. The score, reflecting the number of correctly answered questions, is displayed throughout the game, allowing users to keep track of their performance.

Brain Busters provides a fun and engaging way to learn and test knowledge across a wide array of topics. Whether you are a trivia enthusiast or someone looking for a fun way to learn something new, Brain Busters is the game for you! Feel free to dive in and add your own questions to enhance the challenge. Happy trivia playing!

# Website Development and Photography
As a photographer and web developer, I specialize in creating custom websites without relying on frameworks or libraries. Utilizing HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript on the client side, I employ grid and flex techniques to achieve a fluid, adaptable design. On the server side, I leverage PHP and Object-Oriented Programming to seamlessly integrate a comprehensive Content Management System (CMS), allowing owners or administrators to effortlessly modify content.

My websites are crafted with responsive design principles, ensuring an exceptional user experience on smartphones, tablets, or desktop computers. By incorporating Ajax (Fetch), I provide a seamless browsing experience for visitors. Feel free to explore this website, and if you're interested in collaborating, simply reach out via the contact page. I'll respond as soon as possible.
